# ExUmbra-Reskin-Pack
New sprites for all Vannilla Hideous Destructor weapons and a lot of the pickups.

This (should be) a multiplayer compatable reskin pack for Hideous Destructor.
This pack reskins all vanilla Hideous Destructor weapons and adds black fingerless gloves to their HUD graphics.
So far there are no sounds in this pack, insurgancy fx is a good fit.
